# Static Comp Challenge

## Overview
This project was a solo project challenge for Module 2 of [Turing](https://turing.edu/), the [goal](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/m1-static-comp) of this project was to get practice in with HTML/CSS given a static comp. While creative liscense was given, we still had to maintain the integrity of the original design. Due to my love of both ranking things and drinking sparkling water, I chose to merge the two and create a fake page with definitive rankings of flavors.
